# Sign-Language-classification-project
Using the Sign Language MNIST dataset-a well-known dataset consisting of labeled images
representing hand gestures for ASL alphabets-this project trains a convolutional neural network
(CNN) to accurately classify hand signs. The trained model is then integrated into a web
application, allowing users to input sign language gestures and receive immediate feedback
through the interface.
